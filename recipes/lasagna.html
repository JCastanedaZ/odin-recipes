    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of stacked layers of pasta, sauce, and various fillings such as meat, vegetables, cheese, and herbs. The dish is typically baked in the oven until the pasta is cooked and the cheese on top is melted and bubbly.

        The traditional lasagna recipe includes wide, flat pasta sheets made from wheat flour and eggs, boiled until they are al dente. The pasta sheets are then layered with tomato sauce, ground beef, and ricotta cheese, and topped with mozzarella cheese. Some recipes also include additional layers of vegetables, such as spinach or zucchini, or different types of cheeses, such as Parmesan or provolone.
