        Pasta e Fagioli, also known as pasta fazool, is a traditional Italian dish that translates to "pasta and beans" in English. It is a hearty soup-like dish that is made with pasta, beans, vegetables, and often includes meat.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dish typically starts with a base of sautéed onions, garlic, and carrots in olive oil. Then, tomatoes, broth, and beans (such as cannellini or kidney beans) are added and simmered until the flavors have melded together. Often, small pasta shapes such as ditalini or elbow macaroni are added towards the end and cooked until al dente.
